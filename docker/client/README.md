After adding `lib` files to the Groovy path, script was originally invoked as `NLPADAPT_BROKER_URI="nio://localhost:61616" NLPADAPT_INPUT_DATASOURCE_URI="jdbc:sqlite:mimic-rtf.db" NLPADAPT_OUTPUT_DATASOURCE_URI="jdbc:sqlite:schema.db" groovy <pipeline>_client.groovy`, where `NLPADAPT_BROKER_URI` is the address of an ActiveMQ instance, and `NLPADAPT_INPUT_DATASOURCE_URI` is a database specifier (we're using a local sqlite database for testing) containing the data to be read in by a pipeline. `NLPADAPT_OUTPUT_DATASOURCE_URI` is the destination table. `<pipeline>` is the name of the pipeline being invoked with the client.

The rtf_reader client currently takes `NLPADAPT_BROKER_URI`, `NLPADAPT_DATASOURCE_URI`, `NLPADAPT_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, and `NLPADAPT_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`.
